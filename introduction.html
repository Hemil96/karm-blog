          <p>Hello everyone, since you are here let me first introduce myself, I am Karm Patel, an international student living in Australia, Currently pursuing my Masters in Electrical and Renewable Engineering at Deakin University. Apart from that, I am currently working at Australia post as a sub-contractor and I love to read books, play drums and watch sports.</p>

          <p>To begin with, I must admit that, There is no better time than this to start doing something that you have always delayed. For me, I always enjoyed reading and listening stories of international students and their lifestyles. Therefore, I have decided to cover various aspects of living In foreign country as an international students via this blog.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What you can expect ?</h2>

          <p>Nowadays, the majority of people are planning to study abroad in countries like USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc. Not knowing what lies ahead, they keep their hopes high and plan out everything, thinking everything will fall in the right place as they move forward. But as they say, life has different plans figured out for everyone and struggle starts from the day you put your first step in a new country.</p>

          <p>While many aspiring students in India are keen to know what actual life looks like in Australia, what is the study load, what about part-time jobs, what about permanent residency, what are the chances of getting a field job, whether you can get a part-time job or not, how much you can earn as a student, how much you can work and many more. If you are one of those guys who had any these questions, you have come to the right place.</p>

          <p>In this blog, you will encounter many such stories of international students who might be your friends, relatives, neighbours or colleagues. Whom you know very closely, but still are unaware of their journey. I am sure, every student has his own story, filled with numerous challenges and struggles. And one thing I am certain is that the life of an international student is not what you see in Instagram posts of your friends, It is rather opposite.</p>


          <a href="#">

          </a>

          <p>A life you would be thrilled to know the challenges that you had never seen before. Every one of them has a different story filled with lots of ups and downs. I will try to unfold such journeys through this channel.</p>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Is this blog for you?</h2>

          <p>This blog is for people who are seeking to study overseas and not sure what life will unfold in front of them, It is for people who are back in India and are interested about the life of students in foreign countries, It is for parents who don’t know what their children are going through, It is for those uncles and aunties who says life is set once you move to another country and last but not the least, It is for everyone who is curious in knowing an inspiring journeys of such individuals.</p>

          <p>I am sure, many of you will be having a series of questions or doubts about facts or ideas that have been presented here, you can always contact me on any of my social media handles. I will be more than happy to help you out.</p>

          <p>Because, I know when I was back in India and had doubts about overseas studies and was confused regarding my future destination, I didn’t have any solid source from where I can get honest information about different countries, education system and their pros and cons. Hence, If you have any of these doubts and want to know answers then you have come to the right place.
